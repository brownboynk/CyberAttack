# Cyber Attack, By Ken Chambers and Dev Zaveri

## Project Goals:
### Our project goals were to create a game with the idea of happiness, while also being a fun way to learn about computer science and data algorithms. We used trees and several types of designs that help get our idea across, along with ways to make improvements and add more into the game itself.

## Significance of project:
### For our project, we have decided to make a match-three style of game in the Godot 3 engine. In this game, players will take over the role as a team of cyber security specialists who are going into a computer to rid it of various malware and bugs. In order to successfully fight these issues, players will match tiles in groups of three, four or five to deal damage to the enemies and rid from the system. The way that this project enhances happiness and also creates a safe space is by playing a match-three style of game, not only will players be able to test their skill in this genre of game but they will also be more aware of the issues that the can happen in a system.

## Installation and Usage Instructions:
### To install and get the game running, you are going to need a few things: 1) A download of this project, 2) [Godot 3 game engine](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/windows/) and 3) [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) for your current operating system. Once you have the three of these pieces, you can begin to run the project. To start this project, you must first extract the zip file of both this project file and Godot 3. After this, open Godot and hit the import button, then find the project.godot file within the folder for this project. With the project imported into Godot, you wouild select it from Godot's dashboard and then finally hit the play button to start our game.  

### Once in the game, to start playing the game hit the start button which will then take you to the game's level map. By left-clicking one of these levels, you will be brought into the level and then have ot start making matches of three, four or five pieces to defeat the various enemies in the game.

## Code Structure:
### For the code structure, we started with a basic version of a Match-3 game, which developed into creating sprites and adding databases for resources, such as maps, buttons, UI and more. Along with that, we needed a randomizer to set up the tiles in a specific order, otherwise the game would feel very predictable. Our primary languages throughout this was C# and GodotScript, along with some HTML and Java to understand functionalities and set up presets.

## Functionalities and Test Results:
### For functionalities, the game works well, adding goals to each level and making the player clear each objective before moving forward. Testing how the tree algorithm works with sprites went well as there was lots of formations for dropping tiles from a large randomizer, along with sorting into match 3, 4, and 5. 

## Discussion and Conclusion:
### One the biggest issues that we ran into during the creation of this project is the animation portion of the project. When players make either a match of four or five pieces, a new piece is created that has a different property when compared to the other pieces. The piece is question will either be able to wipe out a whole row in the board either vertically or diagonially, but sometimes it will not display a grayed out version of the original piece instead of the piece that it should display. Along with that, things we could improve on in the future would include more text popups on how computers have both a positive and negative to them, stating various types of malware and antivirus information. Overall this project was a major learning experience, and something we could definitely improve upon within the future.
